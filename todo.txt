Bugs to investigate:
- Product.vue and Cart.vue not pulling data for product template sections properly
- Running into HTTP error with login authentication token

Once these are fixed, moving forward on guide:
- Create "my account" page
- Proceed to checkout (auth)
- Create a "success" page
- Show "my orders" on account page (as components)
- Deploy Django -- create server, install software, create users + venv, packages/files, etc.
